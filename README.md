# SchoolHelp
Application to help with marks from school and make simple lists.

IMPORTANT : Note that neither marks nor lists can be deplaced into other collections from the application.
If you really want to, you have to deplace it from the files.

Mark application

How to create a new mark?
Click on the button "Ajouter une note" to create a new one and then in the dialog form:
    - Enter the subject
    - Enter your mark
    - Select the coefficient
    - Either choose a color for your mark or select the auto color option

What are collections?
Collections are like a folder in which you can create other collections or marks.
To create one, click on the button "Ajouter une collection" and then in the dialog form :
    - Either choose a color for the collection or select the auto color option
Once created, the mark under the name of the collection will be automatically updated 
depending on all the marks inside it.

How does the auto-color option works?
The auto-color option is a way to "quickly see" your marks before even reading it.
- If you choose this option, the color of the mark or the collection will depend on the mark itself.
- You can edit the intervals for each color in the options of this application.

List application

How to create a new list?
Click on the button "Ajouter une liste" to create a new one and then in the dialog form:
    - Choose a name for the list
    - Choose a color for the list
    - Select the number of columns for your list

How do I edit a list?
Click on the button "Ouvrir la liste" and then add or remove lines as you need. 
There are no limits for a list, but the longer your list is, the longer it will take to load and save.

How do I execute my list?
There are 2 modes of execution. First click on the "Ouvrir la liste" button.
Under the button to edit list, there are two colums with your list columns names:
- Select a name in a column to start the list from the column you chose.
    - In the first column, all items will be random, and the execution has no end.
    - In the second column, the whole list will be displayed but in a random way.

What are collections?
Collections are simple folders to help you organize your lists.
 
If you need a more sophisticated list, I invite you to try the MiniExplorator app.
